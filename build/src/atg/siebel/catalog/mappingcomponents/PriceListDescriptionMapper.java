 * The Price List 'Description' is a straight mapping to the ATG 'description'
 * so we dont actually need a custom mapping component for this. This is

 * mapper is setup we cant process the sub-items unless they map to an ATG property
 * and there is no property on priceList for the Price List Items. Therefore 
 * Description,ListOfPriceListItem are combined so Price List Item's can be
 * processed and 'Description' returned to map to 'description'.
