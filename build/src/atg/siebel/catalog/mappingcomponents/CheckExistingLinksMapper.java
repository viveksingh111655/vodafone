   * The reason for this method is there are no notifications of existing links being deleted from Siebel.
   * This method checks the existing links against new ones from an import. Any items which were linked 
   * to but no longer are in the new import should be deleted. 
   *
   * The reason this functionality isn't in ListOfItemMapper is there are some cases where we want to
   * keep the existing links and other cases where we want to remove the existing links. For example a
   * product may be removed from a category but we don't want to delete the product, however an Object
   * Decoration may be removed from a configurable product and we need to remove this from ATG. If the
   * existing links need to stay then use ListOfItemMapper otherwise use this.
   *
   * NOTE: This method relies on the repository defining the list of children as 'java.util.List' for
   * the parent-children relationship. If defined as anything else.a custom mapping component will need
   * to be constructed which overrides this method.  
   *
   * @param itemIds the new item id's to against existing item id's
