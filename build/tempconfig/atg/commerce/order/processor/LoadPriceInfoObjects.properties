# The additional Siebel-specific values of the properties for the LoadPriceInfoObjects processor
#


#
# These are the properties of the AmountInfo which will be loaded from the repository.
# If a class extends AmountInfo, all properties which should be loaded should be
# listed here. By default a property name listed here will be loaded to the
# cooresponding repository item property with the same name. If the name in the bean
# and repository are not the same then it can be mapped in the property
# propertyDescriptorToBeanPropertyMap below.
