# The Siebel Export Container passed to the ATG import web service may or may not be addressable.
# For example the address could be UNC format which is not accessible on Linux (without mounting),
# or the fileshare might need credentials. For our sample solution we are assuming that the fileshare
# where the Export Files are hosted has been mounted or mapped to a local directory/drive prior.
# This file then defines where the fileshare has been mapped/mounted to.
#
# example transforms
#
# \\SomeServer\TestShare=Z:\TestShare
# \\SomeServer2\TestShare2=/local/test
#
# if the Mapper received a Siebel Import File Location of \\SomeServer\TestShare\Jobs\ABC the path
# will be transformed to Z:\TestShare\Jobs\ABC
#
# if the Mapper received a Siebel Import File Location of \\SomeServer2\TestShare2/Jobs/XYZ the
# path will be transformed to /local/test/Jobs/XYZ
#
#
# This solution is certainly not the only way to get around the issue but was implemented like this
# to keep it reasonably simple and configurable. You may need to change the way SiebelXmlTools reads
# in export files depending on your own circumstances.
